  # The JSON module from stdlib provides a safe way of loading data
  # with the `parse` method, but the most widespread API for encoding
  # and decoding data is with the `load` and `dump` methods, which in
  # the case of JSON are unsafe. This module wraps the JSON constant
  # from stdlib in order to expose a safe version of `load`. As the
  # serializer is configurable, the user is expected to provide
  # objects that respond safely to those methods.
